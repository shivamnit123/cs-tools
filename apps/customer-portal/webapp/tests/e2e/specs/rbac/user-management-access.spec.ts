// RBAC: Settings → User Management → "Add User" is admin-only.
//
// The button is gated on the ServiceNow `customer_admin` USER role
// (SettingsPage.tsx reads it from GET /users/me), NOT on project membership.
// That distinction is the point of this spec: Lead, Security Contact and Portal
// user are membership roles, and a contact can hold any of them — even
// `isCsAdmin` on their membership — and still see no admin UI without the
// ServiceNow role.
//
// Covers the full matrix: three project types x four user types = twelve
// accounts. Each test signs in as its own, so this is the one spec that does NOT
// replay the shared session — `withSession` is deliberately absent and each test
// performs a real login. That is slower, and it is the only way to compare what
// different users see.
//
// Read-only: the button's presence is asserted, never clicked, so no user is
// ever created.
//
// ⚠️ TWELVE real sign-ins per run, serially. The IdP rate-limits repeated logins
// in quick succession — a run that fails with the flow restarting at the
// username screen is throttling, not a defect. Narrow with -g to one project
// type while iterating, and re-run the full matrix after a pause.
//

// recording settings, and doing it globally would strip the diagnostics every
// other spec relies on. The `auth` setup project is configured the same way for
// the same reason (see playwright.config.ts).
