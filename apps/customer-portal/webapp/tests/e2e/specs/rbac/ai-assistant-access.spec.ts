// RBAC: Settings → AI Assistant → the AI Chat Assistant (Novera) toggle is
// admin-only.
//
// Gated differently from Add User, which is worth knowing: the AI Assistant TAB
// is visible to every user type, and it is the SWITCH that is restricted — it
// renders DISABLED for anyone without the ServiceNow `customer_admin` role,
// alongside the hint "Users with Admin role can only update this setting". So a
// non-admin can see the setting and its current state, and cannot change it.
// Asserting the tab is absent would be wrong; asserting the switch is disabled
// is the actual contract.
//
// For an admin the toggle is exercised as a ROUND TRIP: whatever state it is
// in, it is flipped to the other and then flipped back. That leaves the project
// exactly as it was found, which matters because `hasAgent` changes what Get
// Help does for every other spec in the suite — a test that left it flipped
// would quietly break the create-case specs.
//
// Covers three project types x four user types. Each test signs in as its own
// account, so `withSession` is deliberately absent — the same approach as
// user-management-access.spec.ts, and the only way to compare user types.
//
// ⚠️ TWELVE real sign-ins per run, serially. The IdP rate-limits repeated logins
// in quick succession — a run that fails with the flow restarting at the
// username screen is throttling, not a defect. Narrow with -g while iterating.

// These specs perform a REAL sign-in — a password and a TOTP code are typed into

// both capture keystrokes and DOM, so a failing test would write those
// credentials into an artefact that CI then uploads and the container emails.
//
// Disabled here rather than in signInAsRole: a helper cannot change project
// recording settings, and doing it globally would strip the diagnostics every
// other spec relies on. The `auth` setup project is configured the same way for
// the same reason (see playwright.config.ts).
