// Opens existing cases — one per severity, across all three project types — and
// checks each detail page shows what it should.
//
// ✅ READ-ONLY. Cases are opened by URL and asserted; nothing is created,
// commented on or closed, so this is safe to run repeatedly.
//
// What is and is not pinned:
//
// - **Severity** is pinned per case, since that is the axis these fixtures exist
//   to cover.
// - **WSO2 case id** and **case number** are asserted by format, not by value —
//   the values differ per case and pinning them would make this a test of
//   staging's contents. The id prefix is per project and is not the project key:
//   Subscription cases read `AUTOMATIONTESTCUSSUB-<n>`, Cloud Support's
//   `AUTOMATIONTESTCUSCLSUB-<n>` and MCS's `AUTOMATIONTESTCUSMSSUB-<n>`.
// - **State** is asserted to be one of the real case states, so a placeholder or
//   a blank would fail.
// - **Subject** and **comment** are pinned per case, every value read off the
//   live pages. Per-case rather than shared because the naming is not uniform:
//   the Subscription and Cloud Support S4 cases carry no severity suffix and no
//   "…with severity" in their comment, while MCS's S4 does.
//
// The header carries the WSO2 case id as well as the Details tab, so those
// assertions run against the header. Comments live on the Activity tab, which is
// the default.
//
// The test then switches to the **Details** tab and checks its five sections and
// their field labels are displayed. Labels are asserted as "present at least
// once" rather than exactly once: several repeat legitimately — the header
// already shows a status and a severity — so requiring uniqueness would fail for
// the wrong reason. The checks are soft, so one run reports every missing field
// rather than stopping at the first.
