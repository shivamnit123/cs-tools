/**
 * The PLG CS engineer picker.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A PLAIN `<TextField select>`, WHICH IS WHAT IT USED TO BE.
 * There are ~1,900 active internal users and the API page limit is 100, so the
 * dropdown only ever listed the first 100 by first name — every engineer from
 * roughly the A's onward was unreachable, with nothing on screen saying so. A
 * picker that silently omits 95% of the people it offers is worse than one that
 * is obviously incomplete.
 *
 * Typing now searches the whole directory server-side. Opening it without
 * typing still shows the same first 100, so the common case — assigning to
 * someone you can see — is unchanged.
 *
 * Debounced at 300ms with no minimum length, matching AsyncAccountMultiSelect,
 * the same pattern csm-cases already uses for account search.
