// HTML — content authored before/without SFTPGo attachment storage never
// gets its pasted image extracted into a real, separately-stored attachment
// at all, so it stays as raw base64 image data inside the comment/case JSON
// itself. The base64 alphabet (`A-Za-z0-9+/=`) never includes `"`, so the
// payload capture naturally stops one character before the JSON string's
// closing quote without needing to look for it explicitly.

// who may not see the real image. It deliberately keeps the "data:image/"
// prefix — apps/csm-portal/webapp's useResolvedInlineImageHtml (see that
// repo's own CLAUDE.md) already recognizes any `data:image/...` src as
// gated content when the caller lacks canDownloadAttachment and swaps in its
// own "You don't have permission to view this image" placeholder UI, so
// this value only has to be inert, not meaningful on its own.

// caller who does not hold PermDownloadAttachment — so the real image bytes
// are never sent to them at all, closing the gap the frontend's own
// denyRawBase64 mitigation left open (that one only hides the image after
// it already reached the browser — see apps/csm-portal/webapp's CLAUDE.md
// for the full history of this gap).
//
// Operates directly on the raw response bytes rather than unmarshaling into
// a typed struct: comment/description HTML appears under different field
// names across endpoints (content, bodyHtml, description, ...) and this
// backend already treats these responses as raw passthrough (see this
// file's own "Response shape" conventions in CLAUDE.md) — a byte-level
// substitution keeps that convention rather than adding a typed reshape
// solely for this, and can't miss a field by name.
//
// A `.iix`-referenced inline image (the SFTPGo-backed path) is untouched:
// its bytes are never in this response at all — the frontend fetches those
// separately via GET /attachments/{id}/content, itself already gated by
