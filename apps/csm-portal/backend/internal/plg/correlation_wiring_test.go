// TestRegister_WiresCorrelationForwardingAroundIdentity covers the one line in
// register() that composes the chain.
//
// The middleware has its own tests, but they exercise it directly — deleting the
// call from register() left every one of them green while no PLG request
// forwarded anything. This drives a request through the REAL registered chain
// instead, and asserts on the header entity-service receives.
//
// It also pins the ORDER. The stub identity below stands in for ResolveIdentity,
// which makes an entity-service call of its own to resolve the caller; it makes
// that call here too. If ForwardCorrelationID were mounted inside identity
// rather than around it, this call — the most frequent PLG request to
// entity-service there is — would go uncorrelated, and the header asserted below
// would be empty.
