// Ladder is which escalation ladder an incident climbs.
//
// There are two, and they share everything except who each rung is and how
// fast it climbs. The CRE ladder is the specification's: five rungs of rank
// (sub lead, lead, heads), on a clock set by the incident's priority. The SRE
// ladder follows the SRE team's own on-call tiers:
//
//	LEVEL_0  L1 support   called as soon as the incident arrives
//	LEVEL_1  L2 support   5 minutes later, if nobody has taken it
//	LEVEL_2  L3 support   5 minutes after that
//	LEVEL_3  L4 support   5 minutes after that - OPT-IN, see SREPolicy
//
// One call per rung, one person per rung, the same clock for every priority --
// and no priority gate at all: an SRE incident gets a ladder whatever its
// priority. It stops when an engineer is assigned to the incident
// (incident.assigned) or the incident leaves NEW; a public comment alone does
// not stop it.
//
// Which ladder an incident climbs is decided by its assignment group: an
// incident assigned to an SRE team climbs the SRE ladder, and everything else
// - including an incident whose team cannot be placed at all - climbs the CRE
// one. Which ladders an incident climbs is the configuration's routing
// section (routing.go): by default an SRE team's incident, a CRE team's P0,
// and any monitoring-raised incident climb this one, and the last two climb
// the CRE one as well -- side by side, each in its own engine and its own
// store namespace.
