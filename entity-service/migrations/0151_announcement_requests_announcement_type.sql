-- Replaces announcement_requests' own bespoke is_security_announcement
-- boolean with the same announcement_type_enum (GENERAL/SECURITY) the
-- "announcement" table already uses (migration
-- 0088_announcement_add_announcement_type, which also defines the enum type
-- itself -- not redeclared here) -- one shared vocabulary for "is this a
-- security announcement" across the whole flow (pre-publish request and
-- published case) instead of two independently-typed columns doing the same
-- job.
--
-- Numbered after both of its prerequisites (0088 for the enum type, 0120
-- for announcement_requests itself, the table this migration alters) --
-- migrations run in sorted filename order, so this must sort after both or
-- a from-scratch schema bootstrap fails outright. Also numbered past 0150
-- deliberately: 0141-0150 are already claimed by the parallel
-- feature/rls-project-scoping work (PR #2094) as of this writing -- a
-- different concern (RLS policies), but sharing that number range would be
-- needlessly confusing even though this repo's own convention tolerates
-- duplicate migration numbers (tracked by full basename, not the number).
