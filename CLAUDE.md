# cs-tools

Repo-wide conventions. Component-specific guidance lives in that component's own
`CLAUDE.md` (`entity-service/`, `apps/csm-portal/backend/`, `apps/csm-portal/webapp/`,
each `integrations/*`, …) — this file is only for things that hold everywhere.

## Always pull and check for conflicts before pushing

Never push a branch without first fetching the target and checking whether it
still merges. `upstream/dev-app-csm-portal` moves fast — it advanced 22 commits
during a single working session — so a branch that merged cleanly an hour ago
may not now, and finding that out at push time (or in review) is later than
necessary.

```bash
git fetch upstream dev-app-csm-portal
git merge-tree --write-tree HEAD upstream/dev-app-csm-portal   # exit 0 = clean, 1 = conflicts
```

`merge-tree` is read-only — it never touches the worktree or the index, so it is
safe to run with uncommitted changes present. Note that it compares *commits*:
uncommitted work is invisible to it, so commit first or check your modified paths
against the target's own changed paths by hand.

Two remotes exist and they are not interchangeable: `upstream` is
`wso2-open-operations/cs-tools` (the real target) and `origin` is a personal fork
whose `dev-app-csm-portal` may be thousands of commits stale. Check against
`upstream`.

## Migrations are keyed by filename — renaming one makes it new

`entity-service/migrations/` is `NNNN_<description>.sql`, forward-only, one file
per migration (see `entity-service/CLAUDE.md`, "Database migrations"). `make
migrate` records each applied file in `csm_migration_applied_migration` by its
**full filename**, and applies every `migrations/*.sql` it has not recorded, in
name order. Three consequences:

- **A number used twice is not a conflict.** Two files that share a number
  both apply, each under its own name (`0026_account_contact_table` and
  `0026_tag_tables` both exist). Git will not warn about it either, so if the
  order between two same-numbered files matters, check which one sorts first.
  Do not rely on the number.
- **A renamed file looks new.** Against a database that already applied the old
  name, it runs again from scratch. It must be safe to re-run, or the rename
  needs a stated reason and a plan for the servers that already have it.
- **Only `NNNN_*.sql` belongs in that folder.** The runner globs `*.sql`, so an
  old-style `000NNN_x.up.sql`/`.down.sql` pair would run both halves, and
  would run them ahead of `0001`. That is how the Team Schedule's original
  files broke `make migrate` until they were rewritten as 0152–0155.

`scripts/csm-compose/migrate-and-seed.sh` (the local compose stack) still
iterates the old `*.up.sql` names and keeps its own `schema_migrations` table.
It has not been moved to the new convention yet.
